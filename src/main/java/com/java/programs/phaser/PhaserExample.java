/*
Phaserâ€™s primary purpose is to enable synchronization of threads that represent one or more phases of activity. It lets us
define a synchronization object that waits until a specific phase has been completed. It then advances to the next phase
until that phase concludes. It can also be used to synchronize a single phase, and in that regard, it acts much like a
CyclicBarrier.
